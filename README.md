# csgo_internal_base
Just another internal cheat base for CS:GO. Currently unfinished.

## Features
* All the necessary Valve interfaces, structs and classes
* Two hooking methods: VMT swapping and GameOverlayRenderer (supports sigged functions)
* Menu framework (ISurface based, incomplete)
* Netvar manager with proxy support
* Config system
* Zero external dependencies
* Basic cheat features: engine prediction, infinite crouch, FOV changer, some other stuff

Keep in mind that although this base has most CS related things implemented, it's probably not fully up to date anymore and might crash unexpectedly.  
It's also missing some features (most notably string encryption) which will be added later on.
